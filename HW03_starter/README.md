### Writeup Questions

(Note: if you use the latex template, you don't need to fill out this section)

#### Visualization

(a) At first, there is only one dot with X = 2 and y = 3. I cannot make an educated guess since there is only one point for known information.

#### Linear Regression

(d) __________________________________________

    ------------------------------------------
(e) Coefficients compared with those computed from SGD are really similar. The difference becomes smaller first, hit the minimum at α= 0.001, then increase when α gets larger.

The run time is shown in result_record.txt, where we can see the time spent on SGD is way larger than this. And they increase significantly as α gets larger.

#### Polynomial Regression

(h)

#### Regularization (optional extension)
