### Analysis Questions

1. What depth did you find "best" for the *heart disease* dataset? For the
*diabetes* dataset?
depth = 6

2. How did you determine that these depth values were the "best"? (i.e. how
  did training and testing accuracy change as the depth changed?)
the testing accuracy increase first and then slowly decreases.

3. If doctors were to use these types of
decision trees when diagnosing patients, what issues might arise? Advantages? Disadvantages?
as the testing data goes up and more data ditributed in a larger range for continuous data, maybe it will be hard to predict
